Weather App using Open Weather API and a free Horoscope API 

## Introduction
This is an app which can give you the weather in your closest major city and a daily horoscope, built using `HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS, Node.js, and Express`. 
This project has been developed to better my understanding of **Servers & APIs** in JavaScript.

## Description
The project started as a simple weather app, then became more complicated when I decided to add the use of a second API. As I worked through the different ways of making each 
part work, I had to also master `error handling, Node.js, and EJS`.
